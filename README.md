# Blood-Bank-System

The Blood Bank Management System is a web-based application developed to manage and streamline the donation and request process for blood. The system allows donors to register and offer blood donations, while recipients can search for and request available blood groups. The system ensures a smooth, organized flow of information between donors, recipients, and administrators.
